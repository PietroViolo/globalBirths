# globalBirths
A Three.js project based on Bruno Simon's ThreeJS Journey course. The application visualizes one minute of deaths (or births) and their geographic locations using glowing coordinates. The data combines the Kontour dataset with the World Population Prospects. Note that the data itself cannot be shared in the repository.

To run the script, you need to type in the terminal \emph{npm install} to install nodes and dependencies, followed by \emph{npm run dev} to run in the browser.
